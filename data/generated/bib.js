        "abstract": " Peer-to-peer electricity transaction is predicted to play a substantial role in research into future power infrastructures as energy consumption in intelligent microgrids increases. However, the on-demand usage of Energy is a major issue for families to obtain the best cost. This article provides a machine learning predictive power trading framework for supporting distributed power resources in real-time, day-to-day monitoring, and generating schedules. Furthermore, the energy optimization algorithm used in machine learning (EOA-ML) is proposed in this article. The machine learning-based platform suggested two modules: fuel trading and intelligent contracts based on machine learning implemented predictive analytical components. The Blockchain module enables peers to track energy use in real-time, manage electricity trading, model rewards, and irreversible transaction records of electricity trading. A predictive analysis component based on previous power usage data is designed to anticipate short-term energy usage in the Intelligent Contracts. This study utilizes data from the provincial Jeju, Korea\u2019s electricity department on true energy utilization. This study seeks to establish optimal electricity flow and crowdsourced, promoting electricity between consumers and prosumers. Power trading relies on day-to-day, practical environmental control and the planning of decentralized power capitals to satisfy the demands of smart grids. Furthermore, it employs data mining technologies to obtain and study time-series research from the past electricity utilization data. Thus, the time series analytics promotes power controllingto better future efficient planning and managingelectricity supplies. It utilized numerous statistical methods to assess the effectiveness of the suggested prediction model, mean square error in different models of machine learning, recurring neural networks. The efficacy of the proposed system regarding the delay, throughput, and resource using hyperleader caliper is shown. Finally, the suggested approach is successfully applied for power crowdsourcing between prosumer and customer to reach service reliability based on trial findings. The actual and predicted cost analysis has been increased (95\\%). It minimizes the delay rate to (40.3\\%) by improving the efficiency rate.",

        "abstract": "A smart grid is the future vision of power systems that will be enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and the Internet of things (IoT), where digitalization is at the core of the energy sector transformation. However, smart grids require that energy managers become more concerned about the reliability and security of power systems. Therefore, energy planners use various methods and technologies to support the sustainable expansion of power systems, such as electricity demand forecasting models, stochastic optimization, robust optimization, and simulation. Electricity forecasting plays a vital role in supporting the reliable transitioning of power systems. This paper deals with short-term load forecasting (STLF), which has become an active area of research over the last few years, with a handful of studies. STLF deals with predicting demand one hour to 24 h in advance. We extensively experimented with several methodologies from machine learning and a complex case study in Panama. Deep learning is a more advanced learning paradigm in the machine learning field that continues to have significant breakthroughs in domain areas such as electricity forecasting, object detection, speech recognition, etc. We identified that the main predictors of electricity demand in the short term: the previous week\u2019s load, the previous day\u2019s load, and temperature. We found that the deep learning regression model achieved the best performance, which yielded an R squared (R2) of 0.93 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.9%, while the AdaBoost model obtained the worst performance with an R2 of 0.75 and MAPE of 5.70%.",

        "abstract": "Summary The global demand for electricity has visualized high growth with the rapid growth in population and economy. It thus becomes necessary to efficiently distribute electricity to households and industries in order to reduce power loss. Smart Grids (SG) have the potential to reduce such power losses during power distribution. Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques have been successfully implemented on SGs to achieve enhanced accuracy in customer demand prediction. There exists a dire need to analyze and evaluate the various machine learning algorithms, thereby identify the most suitable one to be applied to SGs. In the present work, several state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, and Decision Tree classifier, have been deployed for predicting the stability of the SG. The SG dataset used in the study is publicly available collected from UC Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. The experimentation results highlighted the superiority of the Decision Tree classification algorithm, which outperformed the other state of the art algorithms yielding 100\\% precision, 99.9\\% recall, 100\\% F1 score, and 99.96\\% accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Summary The smart grid will allow substantial electricity savings and peak demand savings by potentially supplying utility power for direct load management, the calculation in support of competitive pricing, and even the granular data required for energy usage to be more targeted explicitly at customer needs, the processing of data and predictions for a smart grid in a building with the energy profile and occupants' profile, is challenging. This article has been suggested a Machine Learning-Based Energy-Efficient Framework to analyze the motion of occupants, deliver short-term energy forecasts, and assign renewable energy in the smart grid. Second, an indoor localization device with wireless data analysis collects occupants' profile, and the energy profile is managed by a real-time smart meter network with an electrical charge evaluation. Furthermore, the energy profile and 24-hour profile will be paired with a forecast utilizing an online machine learning framework with an analysis of data in real-time. To decrease peak demand for the primary power grid, the solar energy source is assigned to the further power grids based upon the forecast occupant movement profile and energy consumption profile. On the smart gateway network, the complete power flow with minimal computing resources and a general enabled engine can be controlled. The results of the studies on real-time datasets show that the precision of the suggested energy forecast will increase significantly when compared to the other existing methods.",
